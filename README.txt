Program Purpose:
My program plays a text-based RPG. The user inputs certain 
commands and tries to figure out how to beat the game.

How to Use:
1. Make sure sampler.cpp and commands.txt are in the same file directory
	(If using Cygwin put both files into the correct cygwin home directory)
2. compile sampler.cpp and run
